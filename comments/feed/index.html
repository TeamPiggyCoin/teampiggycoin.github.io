		<description><![CDATA[POSWallet was not a major exchange for PiggyCoin, though with the closure of NovaExchange its loss seems more significant.

Unfortunately I (Mo) am moving countries and don&#039;t have much time for PiggyCoin for the next few months.  We do need to form a larger PiggyTeam though, so please e-mail us and come to the #piggy freenode chatroom if you want to help revitalise this coin.]]></description>

digitalocean.com (the grandaddy of them all)
vpsdime.com
scaleway.com (arm architecture, NOT intel/amd)

As with all vm/vps providers you must setup &#038; configure your solution yourself. By far the easiest to delpoy is a wordpress site on digitalocean.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hello would you mind letting me know which web host 
you&#039;re using? I&#039;ve loaded your blog in 3 different internet 
browsers and I must say this blog loads a lot faster 
then most. Can you recommend a good hosting provider at a honest price?

Cheers, I appreciate it!]]></description>
