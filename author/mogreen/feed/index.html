				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NovaExchange is closing down.  Please withdraw your coins by March 2018.</p>
<p><a href="https://novaexchange.com/news/">https://novaexchange.com/news/</a></p>
<p><em>Kindly note &#8220;Novaexchange&#8221; will have new owners and management effective April 2018, with major upgrades to the exchange to better handle scaling, stability and security.</p>
<p>For better management and security of customer funds we have decided to close down Novaexchange so that the users can withdraw all their funds with no participation/responsibility of action of the new management.</p>
<p>Preliminary plan:<br />
2017-10-30 This information goes public, user registration closes, addcoin page closes, disabling deposits of ETC and ETH<br />
2017-11-30 Deposits disabled for ALL coins, all users get level 3 verified account level<br />
2017-12-15 ONE last deposit scan to take care of deposits made after 2017-11-30<br />
2018-01-31 Email reminder to all registered users<br />
2018-02-28 Trading engine stops, dice game stops, API stops<br />
2018-03-31 Login stop, website replaced with information<br />
2018-04-15 Support closes, all Novaexchange user data removed</p>
<p>Remaining user balances that has not been withdrawn before 2018-04-01 will be considered a donation and is not refundable.</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The majority of coins are being delisted from <a href="https://poswallet.com" target="_blank">PoSWallet</a>, both the exchange and the staking wallet. They are apparently changing to focus on fewer coins, though will re-add some delisted coins back later.</p>
<p>PiggyCoin is being delisted on 6th June. Please withdraw your coins from there immediately, to another exchange such as Cryptopia, or to your personal PiggyBank.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Exchanges</strong></p>
<p>PIGGY is now <a href="https://poswallet.com/exchange/piggy_posw/" target="_blank">traded</a> against POSW at <a href="https://poswallet.com/" target="_blank">poswallet.com</a>!</p>
<p>(<a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1695121.0" target="_blank">POSW</a> is a coin made to support PoSWallet.com.)</p>
<p>Unfortunately the NovaExchange.com <a href="https://novaexchange.com/market/PIGGY_ASAFE/" target="_blank">PIGGY basemarkets</a> (where you could buy many altcoins using your PIGGY) are closing due to low volume!  Please close any open orders you have on the PIGGY basemarkets there in case it doesn&#8217;t happen automatically.  Note that you can still buy and sell PIGGY using Bitcoins, Litecoins, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Coinomi mobile wallet addition</strong></p>
<p>We just need two servers to make this happen.  4 GB RAM each would probably be enough.  Mo is contributing 6 EUR/month for a Scaleway VPS and neurocis is looking into having the other one on his property.  Please contact neurocis if you want to contribute towards a second Scaleway VPS as that might be quicker to set up.</p>
<p><strong>Call for PiggyCoin educational materials</strong></p>
<p>We recently got an e-mail from a homeschooling group asking for cryptocurrency educational resources.  Aside from Mo&#8217;s crossword, there aren&#8217;t really any educational materials out there for PIGGY.  Doesn&#8217;t anyone want to make some?  There is money to pay bounties&#8230;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>PiggyCoin was added to the online staking wallet <a href="https://poswallet.com" target="_blank">POSWallet.com</a>!  You can upload your PIGGYs and other proof-of-stake coins there and leave them working to make interest for you while you enjoy an iced truffle drink.</p>
<p>They also have a faucet (= free coins) and block explorer.  Check them out!</p>
<p>Like an exchange, be careful about leaving many PIGGY there for a long period of time.  The PIGGYs in your own PiggyBank are the only ones that you truly control.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>PiggyCoin was added to some more exchanges recently:</p>
<p>NovaExchange, based in Sweden apparently, has been going for a while:</p>
<p>https://novaexchange.com/market/BTC_PIGGY/<br />
https://novaexchange.com/market/LTC_PIGGY/<br />
https://novaexchange.com/market/DOGE_PIGGY/</p>
<p>and they even have some PIGGY basemarkets!  Examples:</p>
<p>https://novaexchange.com/market/PIGGY_1337/<br />
https://novaexchange.com/market/PIGGY_BUN/<br />
https://novaexchange.com/market/PIGGY_DGB/<br />
https://novaexchange.com/market/PIGGY_RBBT/<br />
https://novaexchange.com/market/PIGGY_LDOGE/<br />
https://novaexchange.com/market/PIGGY_SMLY/</p>
<p>TradeSatoshi, a new exchange with a London, England, mailing address, are in beta until December.</p>
<p>https://www.tradesatoshi.com/Exchange/?market=PIGGY_BTC<br />
https://www.tradesatoshi.com/Exchange/?market=PIGGY_LTC<br />
https://www.tradesatoshi.com/Exchange/?market=PIGGY_DOGE</p>
<p>Crypto-Trade, not sure where they&#8217;re based, even have some fiat deposit options!  Their user interface could use some work though.</p>
<p>https://crypto-trade.net/exchange?base=PIGGY&#038;counter=BTC<br />
https://crypto-trade.net/exchange?base=PIGGY&#038;counter=GBP<br />
https://crypto-trade.net/exchange?base=PIGGY&#038;counter=USD</p>
<p>Note: Please don&#8217;t keep too much money on an exchange in case it gets hacked or the exchange owner runs away!  Be sure to use 2FA/MFA if possible!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Vote for PIGGY on Livecoin, another exchange for the purposes of less centralisation!  <a href="https://www.livecoin.net/voting/index?vote=Piggycoin">https://www.livecoin.net/voting/index?vote=Piggycoin</a></p>
<p>You can vote for free once a month, but you have to have an active account. They consider an account to be active if any money has ever been sent there, even as little as 5 DOGE perhaps.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not necessary to outright win the vote as they pick coins to list from the top 3 or so.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just a reminder: We do have an IRC (chat) channel, #piggy, which we gather on quite regularly. If you don&#8217;t like &#8220;traditional&#8221; IRC (and I don&#8217;t) you can connect via a bridge like matrix/vector chat at this link:</p>
<p><a href="https://vector.im/beta/#/room/#freenode_#piggy:matrix.org">https://vector.im/beta/#/room/#freenode_#piggy:matrix.org</a></p>
<p>One benefit of this &#8220;bridge&#8221; method is you can lurk in the channel from multiple devices, there&#8217;s web and mobile clients, and history is searchable.</p>
